== Introduction
The Warehouse microservice, a component of the SWDA module, manages articles, reorders, and deliveries within
the order system.

== Domain Model

The warehouse manages the product catalog for all branches, including inventory levels, deliveries for individual
orders, and reorders for products that fall below minimum stock levels.

== Class Diagram

The Warehouse Service oversees deliveries, the product catalog, and reorders. Each domain is managed through a
dedicated REST API, implemented within controller classes. Communication with the message bus is facilitated through
interfaces for receiving (MessageListener) and sending (MessagePublisher) messages. The ArticleMessageProcessor class
handles incoming messages from the Order Service, responding with the requested article information. Upon receiving an
order message, the OrderMessageProcessor class initiates a new delivery. Delivery and reorder processing are handled
asynchronously by the DeliveryProcessor and ReorderProcessor classes, respectively, operating in a separate thread.

== Processes

The diagrams below illustrate the key processes within the warehouse service.

=== Article Message Processing
Upon receiving a request for article data via RabbitMQ, the system retrieves the relevant articles from the store's
product catalog within the database. This article data is then transmitted back via RabbitMQ. In the event that a
requested article is not found in the catalog, an error message indicating its absence is returned.

=== Order Message Processing
Upon receiving a message via RabbitMQ indicating a new or modified order, the system verifies if a delivery record
already exists for the respective order. If not, a new delivery record is created. However, if a delivery record does
exist and is not yet marked as delivered or completed, the existing record is updated to reflect the changes. In cases
where a delivery record exists but is already delivered or completed, an error is generated and no adjustments are made
to the delivery.

=== Delivery Processing
Warehouse staff mark deliveries as "delivered" upon shipment. At scheduled intervals, an automated process initiates
delivery processing. Delivered orders are prioritized, and the corresponding reserved items are cleared from the
product catalog. Following this, item reservations for new or modified deliveries are adjusted. If a delivery no longer
contains any items (e.g., due to order cancellation), it is deleted. Lastly, pending orders are updated based on the
availability of items in the warehouse inventory.

=== Reorder Processing
Periodically, the application initiates a reorder processing cycle. Initially, delivered reorders are logged within the
warehouse system. Subsequently, items with low stock levels are identified. If the available stock, after accounting
for reserved items and the potential reorder quantity, remains below the minimum threshold, a reorder is triggered.
The reorder quantity is calculated to ensure that the resulting stock level reaches double the minimum requirement.
Finally, these new reorders are placed with the central warehouse.
